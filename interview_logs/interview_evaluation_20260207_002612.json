In feature engineering you can remove the missing values or encode the data for a model. And then after that create the model. And then after creating the model you can do the model evaluation for better precision and then monitor. And after monitoring you can deploy you can do deployment. You can deploy by creating an API from fast API which is a pipe which if you use Python or you can also use Trimbit connecting the endpoints of the data of the model. So it will be used for deployment also. So as this you can make a pipeline.",
